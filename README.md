# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

It is a crowdfunding campaign project to help Louise raise fund for the play 'Fever'. Using Excel we analyse, organize, sort and visualize the data pulled from the current crowdfunding website to understand the campaigns that were successsful in raising fmatedunds for a particular category. This will help Louise plan her campaign for raising funds for the play similar to the successful campaigns under that category.

Louise can plan to have a goal amount of upto $5000 for a successful campaign.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The data in the Excel had to be formatted and the column data had to be split to provide a better understanding.
The range of goal values were created in a new sheet. When a Pivot table was created for that worksheet , the row labels had to be sorted manually to get a correct chart.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- Most of the theatre campaigns were held in the months of May, June and July.
- Most of those campaigns were had a successful outcome.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- Many campaigns were held with a goal amount between $1000 to $5000.
- 73% of those had a successful outcome.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- The data in the current crowdfunding website is dynamic. 
- We pull the dataset from this website to work on providing a solution. As we work on it, the data in the website might be updated.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- We can create a pivot table and design a pivot chart to analyse the outcomes based on category and subcategory of campaigns held. We can add a filter to see outcomes in different countries.
